# Welcome to client-sdk-swift contributing guide :wave:

Thank you for taking your time to contribute to our Swift SDK!
<br/>
This guide will provide you information to start your own development and testing.
<br/>
Happy coding :dancer:
<br/>

## Requirements :coffee:

- Swift version [5.4 or higher](https://www.swift.org/install/) is required
- A Momento API key is required, you can generate one using the [Momento Console](https://console.gomomento.com)

<br/>

## Examples

All examples are in subdirectories of `Examples`. We currently have a publish-and-subscribe example app in [Examples/topics](./Examples/topics) that demonstrates how to use the Momento Topic Client to both publish and subscribe to a topic. Note that, as detailed in the example app README, you'll need to create a cache called `my-cache` before running the app. You can use the [Momento Console](https://console.gomomento.com) to create the cache.

## Build :computer:

You can build the SDK using either `swift build` or `make build` from the root of the repository.

## Running tests

Coming soon
