# Momento Topics Example

## Prerequisites

A Momento API key is required, you can generate one using the [Momento Console](https://console.gomomento.com). 

If using XCode, enter your API key as an environment variable:

1. Navigate to Product > Scheme > Edit scheme
2. Select the `arguments` tab
3. Create a new environment variable (the example expects it to be named `MOMENTO_API_KEY`), then paste your API key without quotations.

## Running the example

Navigate to the example directory:

```
cd Examples/topics
```

Then you can use the command line to compile and run the example like so:

```
swift build
swift run
```
